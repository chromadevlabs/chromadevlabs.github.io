## Designing a robot vacuum cleaner (part 2)

It turns out the magnets that come with the AS5600 sensor boards will fix themselves to the rear shaft quite nicely.. I designed and printed a carrier plate that fixes the sensor to the rear of the motor and a little shim that keeps the magnet dead center.

There was some confusion as I realised I had Nema 17 motors NOT 14.. Whoops!


I plan to attach the wheel hubs directly to the shaft, I assume they will be powerful enough for direct drive but.. I have been wrong before.
